Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - 

****Day 0:** April 17. Sunday**

Today's Progress: Spent time in a single program which took me quiet a long time

Thoughts: Feels good and excited to Code.I struggled a lot and googled how it can be done. I solved it my own. It took me almost more than 1 hour to solve this.
